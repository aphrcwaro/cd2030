### DHIS2 Login Information

This application requires DHIS2 login credentials to download data. You will need 
to enter your DHIS2 username and password each time you use the app, whether you 
are accessing it locally or through a hosted server. 

### Security and Privacy

- **No data storage**: The application does not store your login credentials in 
  the environment. Credentials are used only for the session to securely access 
  and download data from DHIS2.
- **Temporary access**: Your DHIS2 credentials are only used temporarily during y
  our session to authenticate data requests and are not retained after the session 
  ends.

### Open Source Transparency

The app is open source, allowing anyone to verify the code and ensure it adheres 
to security best practices. If you have any security concerns, you can review or 
run the application from the source code directly, which provides transparency and 
assurance that your credentials are used safely.

For both hosted and local environments, this process ensures that sensitive 
information is handled responsibly and securely.
