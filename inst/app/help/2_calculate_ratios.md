#### Purpose
Ratios are key metrics in internal consistency checks, enabling the assessment of data quality and alignment between related indicators in health facility data. These ratios help identify discrepancies, trends, and potential data recording or reporting errors.

#### Key Ratios

1. **ANC1 to Penta1 Ratio**
   - **Definition**: The ratio of antenatal care visits (ANC1) to the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine (Penta1).
   - **Significance**: Indicates the alignment between maternal health services (ANC1) and child immunization services (Penta1).
   - **Expected Range**: 1.05 to 1.10 under normal conditions where survey coverage is consistent.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - A ratio significantly above or below this range suggests potential gaps in service delivery or data reporting.

2. **Penta1 to Penta3 Ratio**
   - **Definition**: The ratio of the first dose to the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine.
   - **Significance**: Highlights the dropout rate in immunization services between the first and third doses.
   - **Expected Range**: Derived from survey data and typically close to 1.0 under ideal circumstances.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Ratios significantly less than 1.0 may indicate high dropout rates, which require investigation.

3. **OPV1 to OPV3 Ratio**
   - **Definition**: The ratio of the first dose to the third dose of the oral polio vaccine (OPV).
   - **Significance**: Identifies inconsistencies in polio immunization services across doses.
   - **Expected Range**: Similar to Penta1 to Penta3, with deviations highlighting service delivery gaps.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - A low ratio may point to challenges in ensuring full immunization cycles.

#### Importance of Ratios
- **Detect Anomalies**: Ratios falling outside the expected range signal potential data quality issues, such as underreporting or overreporting.
- **Highlight Service Gaps**: Significant deviations indicate possible gaps in service delivery or challenges in follow-up for complete immunization cycles.
- **Inform Interventions**: Results from ratio analysis guide targeted actions, such as training staff or improving data collection processes.

#### Recommendations for Interpretation
1. **Compare Across Years**:
   - Observe trends over multiple years to detect systemic issues or improvements.
   
2. **Investigate Outliers**:
   - Identify districts with extreme values and assess their causes, such as data recording errors or service delivery challenges.

3. **Leverage Custom Ratios**:
   - Use custom ratio analysis to explore less common relationships between indicators, providing deeper insights into specific aspects of health service delivery.

By analyzing these ratios, users can uncover inconsistencies, improve data reliability, and ultimately enhance decision-making in health program evaluations.
