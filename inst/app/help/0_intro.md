### Overview

The **Countdown to 2030 for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health**, in co
llaboration with the **Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (G
FF)**, **UNICEF**, **WHO**, **WAHO**, and other partners, is working to strengthen 
country-led progress and performance reviews. These include key health assessments 
such as annual health sector reviews and midterm reviews of investment cases.

### Immunization Coverage Monitoring

Immunization is among the most effective interventions to improve child survival 
and development. Consistent, high-quality immunization coverage estimates are 
essential to track the performance of immunization programs at both national and 
subnational levels. Furthermore, **monitoring inequalities** is critical to 
identify non-immunized populations and inform targeted program interventions.

### Data Sources

National immunization programs have a longstanding tradition of tracking 
immunization coverage across district, regional, and national levels using a 
variety of data sources, including:

- **Population-based surveys** (e.g., DHS, MICS, socioeconomic, and special 
  immunization coverage surveys) that provide disaggregated coverage statistics
  by socioeconomic status, residence (urban/rural), subnational region, age, and
  gender.
- **Health facility and program data** that contribute to routine monitoring.

These data sources help immunization programs understand the coverage landscape 
and target interventions accordingly.

### Package Goals and Objectives

The **cd2030** R package is designed to support the immunization programs of 
ministries of health and national public health institutions in 
**26 sub-Saharan African countries** under the Countdown to 2030 initiative. 
The package aims to:

- **Strengthen vaccination coverage and equity analyses** at national and 
  subnational levels.
- Enable immunization programs to contribute effectively to 
  **regional and global monitoring** efforts.

The long-term objective is to **build country capacity** for immunization analysis 
so that these analyses and official estimates are increasingly country-driven and 
robust.

This package will play a crucial role in supporting immunization monitoring, 
addressing coverage gaps, and ensuring that data-driven insights can guide policies
to improve immunization access for all children.
