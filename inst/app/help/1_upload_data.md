#### Uploading Health Facility Data (HFD)

This application enables users to upload health facility data (HFD) for analysis. Supported file formats include:

- **Health Facility Data**: Excel files (`.xls` and `.xlsx`)
- **Master Dataset**: Stata files (`.dta`) and R data files (`.rds`)

Simply drag and drop your file into the uploader or use the "Browse" button to locate the file on your device. The application is designed to facilitate quick and efficient data processing.

#### Guidelines for Uploading Data

1. **Prepare Your Data**:
   - Ensure that your data is in one of the supported file formats:
     - **Excel files** (`.xls`, `.xlsx`) for health facility data.
     - **Stata files** (`.dta`) and **R data files** (`.rds`) for master datasets.
   - Use standardized templates, such as the Countdown HFD spreadsheet, for better compatibility and data quality.

2. **Upload Your Data**:
   - Drag and drop the file into the uploader or use the "Browse" button to locate the file on your device.

3. **Validation and Feedback**:
   - After uploading, the application validates the file and provides immediate feedback:
     - **Successful Upload**: A confirmation message will appear, and your data will be ready for analysis.
     - **Failed Upload**: If the file format is unsupported or the file contains errors, a generic error message will prompt you to check and re-upload the corrected file.

#### Supported Data Types

- **Health Facility Data**:
  - Operational, coverage, or service-related metrics specific to health facilities.
  - Key indicators might include vaccination coverage, service delivery, and facility performance metrics.

- **Master Dataset**:
  - Supplementary data to link or analyze alongside health facility data.
  - Useful for denominators, subnational analyses, and equity evaluations.

By following these guidelines, users can seamlessly upload their data and ensure it is correctly processed for subsequent analyses. This streamlined process supports data quality assessments, equity evaluations, and coverage estimates, facilitating effective decision-making.
