### Reporting Rate Indicators

This document explains the key reporting rate indicators used to assess the quality 
and completeness of monthly health facility reporting, particularly for immunization 
data. These indicators are essential for evaluating data quality, identifying gaps, 
and guiding improvements in data collection and reporting practices.

### Indicators

#### 1. Completeness of Monthly Facility Reporting

This indicator is based on the submission of monthly immunization reporting forms 
by health facilities. It serves as a foundational metric for evaluating reporting 
consistency and ensuring data completeness across the national health system.

#### 1a. Percentage of Expected Monthly Facility Reports (National)

- **Numerator**: Number of monthly facility reports received.
- **Denominator**: Total number of expected facility reports, which is typically 
  calculated as 12 times the number of facilities that are expected to report on 
  the service.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Reporting rates above 90% are generally considered strong and reflect reliable 
    data collection practices.
  - Changes in reporting completeness over time can impact trend analysis and may
    indicate variations in program implementation.

#### 1b. Percentage of Districts with Facility Reporting Completeness â‰¥ 90%

- **Numerator**: Number of districts achieving at least 90% completeness in monthly
  facility reporting for the year.
- **Denominator**: Total number of districts.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - This indicator helps identify districts with low reporting completeness over 
    multiple years, flagging areas where data collection and reporting might need 
    strengthening.
