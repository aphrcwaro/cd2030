\title{Plot District Reporting Rate Summary}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_district_reporting_rate}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_district_reporting_rate} data frame containing reporting rate data,
processed by \code{\link[=calculate_district_reporting_rate]{calculate_district_reporting_rate()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the plotting function.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object visualizing reporting rates across indicators and years.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot displaying the percentage of districts with reporting rates below
the defined threshold for multiple indicators across various years. This plot provides
a quick visual assessment of district-level reporting compliance across indicators
like ANC, Institutional Delivery, PNC, Vaccination, OPD, and IPD.
}
\details{
This function inverts reporting rate percentages to display the proportion of
districts with rates below the threshold for each indicator (e.g., if a district
achieves a 95\% rate, it shows as 5\% below threshold). Each indicator is visualized
in a separate panel with data grouped by year, providing an overview of performance
trends over time.

Indicators plotted include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Antenatal Care (ANC)} - Percentage of districts meeting or exceeding target rates
\item \strong{Institutional Delivery} - Institutional delivery compliance over time
\item \strong{Postnatal Care (PNC)} - Districts' PNC service rates against thresholds
\item \strong{Vaccination} - Vaccination service coverage at district level
\item \strong{Outpatient Department (OPD)} - OPD reporting rates in districts
\item \strong{Inpatient Department (IPD)} - IPD reporting compliance by district
}

The plot output includes a title, axis labels, and a legend for year, allowing
users to identify service areas with low reporting compliance.
