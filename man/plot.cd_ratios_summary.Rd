\title{Plot Ratios Summary for Indicator Ratios Summary Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_ratios_summary}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_ratios_summary} object created by the \code{calculate_ratios_summary} function.
It should contain a \code{year} column and one or more columns with names starting with \code{"Ratio"},
representing the calculated indicator ratios.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to other methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing a bar plot of indicator ratios by year.
}
\description{
This function generates a bar plot for a \code{cd_ratios_summary} object,
displaying the calculated indicator ratios for each year. It allows
for visual comparison across years, showing how each indicator ratio
changes over time.
}
\details{
This function provides a visual summary of indicator ratios, with each ratio displayed
as a bar for each year. The \verb{Expected Ratio} row is included if available, allowing
for easy comparison of actual ratios against expected values. The bars are grouped
by year, with distinct colors representing each year for clear differentiation.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming `cd_ratios_summary` is the object returned by `calculate_ratios_summary`
  plot(cd_ratios_summary)
}
