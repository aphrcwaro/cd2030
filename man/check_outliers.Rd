\title{Check for Outliers in Indicator Data}
\usage{
check_outliers(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing indicator data for districts and years. The data frame should be processed
with calculated outlier flags (columns ending in \verb{_outlier5std}), where 1 indicates an outlier and 0 a non-outlier.}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_outliers_summary} object (data frame) containing the yearly summary of non-outliers as a
percentage, with each indicator reported individually and a calculated overall mean.
}
\description{
This function identifies and quantifies extreme outliers for a specified set of indicators in a dataset,
flagging them if values fall beyond five times the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the median.
It returns the percentage of non-outliers for each indicator by year, reflecting data quality trends.
}
\details{
The function operates as follows:
\itemize{
\item Collapses the data by year, calculating the mean percentage of non-outliers for each indicator.
\item Aggregates indicators by calculating the mean percentage of non-outliers across all indicators to provide
an annual summary.
}

The function uses the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method for robust outlier detection, ensuring that only
extreme deviations from the median are flagged.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Check for extreme outliers in indicator data
  check_outliers(data)
}

# Output: Percentage of monthly values that are not extreme outliers, by year
