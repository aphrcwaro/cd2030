\title{Compute Indicator Numerators for Health Metrics by Administrative Level}
\usage{
compute_indicator_numerator(
  .data,
  admin_level = c("national", "admin_level_1", "district")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{cd_data} tibble containing health indicator counts, with required
indicators organized by the \code{indicator_groups} attribute.}

\item{admin_level}{A character string specifying the administrative level to calculate
numerators for. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"national"}: Aggregates data at the country level.
\item \code{"admin_level_1"}: Aggregates data at the first administrative level.
\item \code{"district"}: Aggregates data at the district level.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with yearly totals for each indicator at the specified administrative
level, grouped by year, and additional grouping variables as per the chosen level.
}
\description{
\code{compute_indicator_numerator} calculates the numerators for various health indicators
across specified administrative levels, including national, admin_level_1, and district.
This function aggregates counts by year and selected administrative level(s) for a
comprehensive view of health metrics at each level.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Validation}: Confirms that \code{.data} is a \code{cd_data} object and contains
required columns for specified indicators.
\item \strong{Aggregation}: Sums the counts for each indicator, grouped by \code{year}, and
additional grouping variables as per the chosen \code{admin_level}.
\item \strong{Output}: Returns a tibble ordered by \code{year}, containing aggregated indicators
alongside the \code{year}, and administrative level columns.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate national-level totals for health indicators
national_totals <- compute_indicator_numerator(dhis2_data, admin_level = "national")

# Calculate district-level totals for health indicators
district_totals <- compute_indicator_numerator(dhis2_data, admin_level = "district")
}
