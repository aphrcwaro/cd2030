\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{cd_data} tibble containing DHIS-2, UN, ANC-1, and Penta-1 data.}

\item{admin_level}{Character. Specifies the level for calculations, options include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"national"}: Aggregates data at the national level.
\item \strong{"admin_level_1"}: Aggregates data at the first administrative level.
\item \strong{"district"}: Aggregates data at the district level.
}}

\item{un_estimates}{Unestimates data}

\item{sbr}{Numeric. The stillbirth rate.}

\item{nmr}{Numeric. Neonatal mortality rate.}

\item{pnmr}{Numeric. Post-neonatal mortality rate.}

\item{anc1survey}{Numeric. Survey coverage rate for ANC-1.}

\item{dpt1survey}{Numeric. Survey coverage rate for Penta-1 (DPT1).}

\item{twin}{Numeric. Twin birth rate, default is 0.014.}

\item{preg_loss}{Numeric. Pregnancy loss rate, default is 0.03.}
}
\value{
A tibble of class \code{cd_indicator_coverage}, containing calculated
denominators and coverage indicators for the specified administrative level.
}
\description{
\code{calculate_indicator_coverage} computes denominators and coverage indicators for various
health metrics at specified administrative levels (national, admin_level_1,
and district). It integrates data from multiple sources, including DHIS-2,
UN estimates, ANC-1, and Penta-1 survey data.
}
\details{
This function processes demographic and health coverage indicators at various
administrative levels, including:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DHIS-2 Projections}: Calculates indicators based on DHIS-2 projections for
pregnancies, deliveries, births, and vaccination eligibility.
\item \strong{UN Estimates} (national level only): Provides similar indicators but based
on UN projections.
\item \strong{ANC-1 Survey Data}: Uses ANC-1 survey coverage for estimating target
population metrics.
\item \strong{Penta-1 Survey Data}: Uses Penta-1 (DPT1) survey coverage for estimating
vaccine eligibility.
}

The computed indicators support data-driven insights into healthcare coverage
at selected administrative levels.
