\title{Plot National Denominators: Population or Births}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_national_denominators}(x, metric = c("population", "births"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_national_denominators} object containing national-level
demographic data.}

\item{metric}{A character string specifying the type of data to plot. It must
be one of:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"population"}: Plots total population estimates in thousands from DHIS-2 and UN sources.
\item \strong{"births"}: Plots total live births in thousands from DHIS-2 and UN sources.
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used in this function).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object visualizing the selected demographic data over time.
}
\description{
This function generates a plot to visualize national-level demographic data
for either total population or total live births over time. It allows a
comparison between DHIS-2 and UN projections for the specified metric, enabling
easy tracking of trends and discrepancies between these two data sources.
}
\details{
The \code{plot.cd_national_denominators} function provides two distinct visualizations
based on the selected \code{metric}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Population Plot}: Shows total population (in thousands) by year, with
separate lines for DHIS-2 and UN projections.
\item \strong{Live Births Plot}: Displays total live births (in thousands) by year,
also comparing DHIS-2 and UN projections.
}

The function dynamically adjusts the y-axis limits based on the maximum values
in the dataset to ensure a consistent scale and clear visualization. Each line
in the plot is accompanied by points to indicate yearly data, with legend labels
and colors specified for easy differentiation between DHIS-2 and UN data.

  # Plot total population estimates
  plot(cd_national_denominators_data, metric = "population")

  # Plot total live births estimates
  plot(cd_national_denominators_data, metric = "births")
