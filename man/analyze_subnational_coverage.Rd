\usage{
analyze_subnational_coverage(
  .data,
  country_name,
  level = c("admin_level_1", "district"),
  indicator = c("bcg", "anc1", "pcv3", "opv1", "opv2", "opv3", "penta2", "pcv1", "pcv2",

}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the subnational health coverage data.}

\item{country_name}{A character string specifying the country for analysis.}

\item{level}{A character string specifying the administrative level to analyze
(either "admin_level_1" or "district").}

\item{indicator}{A character string specifying the health indicator to analyze
(e.g., "bcg", "measles1").}

\item{denominator}{A character string specifying the denominator to use for
coverage calculations (e.g., "dhis2", "anc1", "penta1").}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_subnational_coverage} object containing calculated metrics such
as coverage, MADM, MRDM, and population shares.
}
\description{
Calculates health coverage and disparity metrics, such as Mean Absolute
Difference to the Mean (MADM), weighted MADM, Mean Relative Difference to the
Mean (MRDM), and weighted MRDM, for a specified subnational level and health
indicator. The function returns a \code{cd_subnational_coverage} object with
calculated metrics for plotting and summarizing.

\dontrun{
data <- analyze_subnational_coverage(.data, "Kenya", level = "district",
     indicator = "measles1", denominator = "penta1")
