\title{Check for Extreme Outliers at District Level}
\usage{
check_outlier_district(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the processed indicator data with outlier flags (e.g., \verb{*_outlier5std}).}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_extreme_outliers} object summarizing the percentage of districts without extreme
outliers by year. The output includes each indicator's percentage and an overall yearly mean
percentage for non-outliers across all indicators.
}
\description{
This function identifies and aggregates extreme outlier counts for various indicators
by calculating the maximum outlier flag for each indicator within each district and year.
An extreme outlier for an indicator in a given district is flagged when the value lies
more than five standard deviations from the median, based on the Hampel X84 method.
This function outputs the percentage of districts without extreme outliers per indicator,
summarized by year.
