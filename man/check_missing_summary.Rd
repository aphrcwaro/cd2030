\usage{
check_missing_summary(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{cd_data} object containing a \code{quality_metrics} attribute, which is a data frame that
includes columns indicating missing values, prefixed with \code{mis_}.}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_missing_summary} object that includes a data frame summarizing the yearly percentages of
non-missing values for each indicator, as well as an average percentage of non-missing values across
all indicators for each year.
}
\description{
This function calculates the yearly percentage of non-missing values for a given set of indicators.
It assesses the availability of data by examining columns with prefixes of \code{mis_}, which represent
indicators for missing values across various data points. For each year, the function computes the
mean percentage of non-missing values for all indicators, resulting in a summary of data completeness
over time.
