\title{Calculate District-Level Reporting Rates by Year}
\usage{
calculate_district_reporting_rate(.data, threshold = 90)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame of class \code{cd_data} containing district-level
reporting rates.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value representing the minimum acceptable reporting
rate threshold (default is 90).}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{cd_district_reporting_rate}, containing the
percentage of districts with reporting rates above the specified threshold
for each indicator and a mean reporting rate.
}
\description{
\code{calculate_district_reporting_rate} calculates the percentage of districts with
reporting rates above a specified threshold for each year across various indicators.
The function provides a summary of the percentage of districts meeting the threshold
for each indicator and includes a mean reporting rate for each year.
}
\details{
This function supports subnational data quality assessments by
identifying districts with low reporting completeness for defined indicators.
Calculating the percentage of districts with acceptable reporting rates
provides insight into data quality gaps and helps target data quality
improvements at the district level, as outlined in Countdown 2030 guidance.
